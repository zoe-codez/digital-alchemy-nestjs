# Examples

This folder contains more practical examples of how to use the libraries.
These examples are not published, but are runnable by cloning this repo and running locally.

## Limitations

The dynamic typing system is not present within this repository for technical reasons.
Code will be valid, but attempts to edit code and receive Typescript validation will not work.
Results will be different when these libraries are installed as `node_modules`, and `@steggy/hass-type-generate` has been run.

## `Home Assistant` based

A reference docker install of Home Assistant is provided for use with these examples.
It is possible to use all the code with an existing install, but there may be additional cleanup work involved.
