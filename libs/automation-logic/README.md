# @steggy/automation-logic

## Description

This library is intended to interact with `@steggy/home-assistant`, but this library attempts to provide some more opinionated logic and automation related tools.
The primary functionality of this library is wrapped up in the idea of **scene rooms**.
These are these are special providers that are intended to represent their real world counterparts, containing the logic directly related to them.
