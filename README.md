# ðŸ¦• [@steggy](https://github.com/mp3three/steggy) monorepo

`@steggy` is a collections of libraries built on top of the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework.
It features a quick bootstrapping interface, powerful configuration and helper services, flexible terminal utilities, and more!

The primary focus of this library is non-web applications, such as terminal apps, home automation services, and other standalone microservices.

## Local Setup (try things out!)

> `@steggy` targets node 16+

```bash
# Check out code
git clone git@github.com:mp3three/steggy.git
cd ./steggy
# Install node modules
yarn
```

## Applications

Applications built as functionality demos, and utilities for consumption in other repositories.

### [Config Builder](apps/config-builder)

A script to manage file based configurations for applications based off `@steggy/boilerplate`.
It can act as a "settings screen" for applications, outputting either environment variables, or to more persistent configuration files.

> In repo example

```bash
# generate example config
npx nx scan-config sampler-app
# run config-builder with config
DEFINITION_FILE=./dist/configs/sampler-app.json npx nx serve config-builder
```

> Standalone example

```bash
# install config builder
yarn add -D @steggy/config-builder
# output configuration to file
node ./your_script.js --scan-config > ./config.json
# launch script
npx config-builder --definition_file ./config.json
```

### [Sampler App](apps/sampler-app) (active development)

Demo app for TTY library functionality. Get a quick feel for how things look and work from inside your terminal.

```bash
# run dev server
npx nx serve sampler-app
```

### [Hass CLI](apps/hass-cli) (active development)

```bash
# run dev server with credentials passed in via environment variables
BASE_URL=http://homeassistant.some.domain TOKEN=long_lived_access_token npx nx serve hass-cli
```

Basic interactions with Home Assistant, in the form of a terminal app.
Exists as both a convenience/development tool, and a place for practical testing of functionality provided by `@steggy/home-assistant`.

### [Hass Type Generate](apps/hass-type-generate)

> Note: requires credentials for home assistant, best practice is to store in `~/.config/hass-type-generate`

Companion application to `@steggy/home-assistant`. Intended to rewrite library type definitions to match a specific home assistant install.
Has no function from within this repo, must be installed as a node_module in a separate repo to have an effect.
`@steggy/home-assistant` will run this script as a post install hook to keep it's own definitions as up to date as possible.
It can also be run manually as needed.

```bash
# install
yarn add -D @steggy/hass-type-generate
# execute
npx hass-type-generate
```

### [Log Formatter](apps/log-formatter)

Pipe JSON logs in via stdin, get pretty/readable logs out.
Fills same idea as [pino-pretty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pino-pretty), but using the `SyncLogger` formatter from this repo so logs will format the same as during development.

## Libraries

### [Automation Logic](libs/automation-logic)

A set of tools for more cohesively bringing together `@steggy/home-assistant` with home automation logic.
Build out rooms with scenes, managed circadian lighting, and more.

### [Boilerplate](libs/boilerplate)

NestJS application bootstrapping functions, configuration, logging, and general purpose tools.

### [Home Assistant](libs/home-assistant)

Tools for interacting with Home Assistant. Contains wrappers for rest api, and websocket api.
Has the ability to transform it's internal type definitions and code api to match a target home assistant install.

### [MQTT](libs/mqtt)

Simple MQTT bindings.

### [Server](libs/server)

Enables web server functionality for [@steggy/boilerplate](libs/boilerplate).
Provides generic middleware tools like `cors` and automatic request logging

### [TTY](libs/tty)

Utilities for creating terminal applications.

- Menus
- Prompts
- Keyboard management
- Screen management
- Cursor management

Enables the `--help` switch, which will output available configuations that can be sent via command line switches.

> Note: switches are accepted without TTY, this just adds a reporting mechanism
